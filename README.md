# MetaMask ERC-7715 Permissions Extension for Scaffold-ETH 2

MetaMask's ERC-7715 permission lets you request fine-grained permissions from a MetaMask user 
to execute transactions on their behalf. For example, a user can grant your dapp permission to 
spend 10 USDC per day to buy ETH over the course of a month. Once the permission is granted, 
your dapp can use the allocated 10 USDC each day to purchase ETH directly from the MetaMask 
user's account.

This extension demonstrates the end-to-end flow for requesting a permisison, and executing transaction on the user's behalf under the given scope of the permission.
